    <title>CP Dev 2 - Project Proposal</title>

    <h1><span>CP Dev 2 - Jasmine's Project Proposal</span></h1>
    <p>For my capstone project, I want to create an interactive food guide that combines the Davis Centennial Seal with finding affordable food options or restaurants in the city of Davis. The target audience includes people who are aged 18+. Last weekend, I went downtown and found out many Davis residents love hanging out at restaurants. The food guide highlights affordable food options and restaurants in the city of Davis that align with the university's values of sustainability, local sourcing, and healthy living. In the project, I will incorporate the Davis Centennial Seal into the design of the guide.

        To create the food guide, I will research affordable food options and categorize the food options. I will need to include places that offer discounts or promotions or prioritize sustainability and locally sourced ingredients. Food options are categorized based on cuisine, dietary restrictions, and price points. To make my project more interesting, I want to create seal stickers that can be found in different restaurants and places. The visitors can do a seal sticker scavenger hunt to collect different seal stickers. This helps to promote the university's values and create a sense of community among the users of the guide.

        I am planning to work on my own for this project. I am not sure if anyone else has a similar idea as mine. However, I am still not sure about finding affordable restaurants. I think I might need to communicate with every restaurant that will be on the food guide and ask them to place seal stickers at their restaurants.
