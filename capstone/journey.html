    <p>Here's the edited text:

        "My partner made an excellent point about connecting local restaurants with the Davis Centennial Seal. She suggested that for creating a food guide, I should research local restaurants that use locally-sourced food and showcase their efforts towards promoting agriculture.
        </p>
        <p> During testing, my partner asked if users could see each other's seal after generating their own. I think I will attempt to allow users to view others' submissions if I have enough time to work on the capstone project. This feature can foster a sense of community and encourage users to share their experiences and recommendations.</p>
