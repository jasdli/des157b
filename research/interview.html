        Franki: An English major student who lived in Illinois for college. She only visited Davis a couple times. 
    </p>
    <h2>Takeaway</h2>
    <p>During the group interview, Franki shared her impressions of the city of Davis. She expressed a preference for living in a bustling metropolis rather than a college town like Davis. Franki's initial encounter with Davis occurred when she was just 14 years old, and she found the city to be expansive and captivating. However, as she revisited Davis in subsequent years, her perspective shifted. Due to the brevity of her recent visit, Franki  did not have the chance to explore local restaurants beyond a few boba places and an Indian restaurant.
    </p>
    <p>On the other hand, Weimei, who has resided in Davis for a considerable period, offered a brief account of her own experiences. She emphasized her fondness for the local restaurants in city. Weimei holds a deep appreciation for the authentic flavors and unique character of these independent restaurants. It's not only her friends' preferences that draw her to local dining spots but also her personal belief that they better align with her own culinary tastes. She holds a special affinity for Asian cuisine, making Asian restaurants her top choice.
    </p>
    <p>Considering the target audience of incoming Davis students and freshmen, who may be unfamiliar with the city, the interviews with Franki and Weimei have sparked a renewed enthusiasm within me for promoting local restaurants in Davis. Not only do these establishments provide diverse and authentic culinary experiences, but they also contribute to the promotion of Davis agricultures. Understanding their perspectives and experiences has further strengthened my commitment to advocating for these establishments and encouraging newcomers to explore the culinary treasures the city has to offer.
