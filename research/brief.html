        Project Summary: My project will be in the desktop version. My capstone project is helping Davis newcomers explore local restaurants. I want to create a food guide of Davis local restaurants and Farmer’s Market. My users need to take photos of the food they had from restaurants I listed in the guide. Once they upload those images to my website, my website will generate customized seals for individual users!

        Project Goals: The primary goal of my project is to inform my users about lists of restaurants that offer healthy and affordable food options at Davis. The secondary goal is to promote engagement and make social connections between Davis people and restaurants.

        Design Strategies: First, I want my website to create a welcoming and inclusive vibe to my users, especially for those who are new to the city. Creating a sense of community is the important aspect of my website. From the food map, I will provide helpful resources and recommendations. 
The primary color design for my website will be green, which relates to sustainability. Other than primary color green, I will be using other natural and earthy tones that reflect sustainability and environmentalism. To keep my design cohesive, I will use a consistent color palette throughout my website. I will place related restaurants close to each other to create a visual grouping, which is organizing restaurants by categories.

        Interaction Strategies: My interaction strategy includes user-generated content, which encourages users to upload their food images. Users will be able to generate their own seal,  which is a collage of food photos in seal shape. They can also see other people’ submissions after they upload their seals. I believe when users are able to interact with my website and see others’ seals, they feel more involved and invested in the experience.

        Experience Goals: I hope my users will learn more about Davis restaurants from my food guide. I want them to feel the sustainable and inclusive environment of Davis by physically being at the restaurants. After exploring, they are also able to store their memories by making their own seals.
