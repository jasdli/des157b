    <h1>Annotated Bibliography</h1>
    <h2>The UC Davis Plant-Based Guide</h2>
    <p>The food guide listed possible vegan restaurants at Davis. Vegan restaurants offer more options for people with dietary restrictions or preferences. Plant-based dishes have more health benefits compared to animal-based meals. They are often more affordable than animal-based dishes due to the lower cost of ingredients. plant-based ingredients such as vegetables, grains, and legumes are typically less expensive and more widely available. I want to include vegan restaurants from the guide to my capstone project. Vegan restaurants promote more sustainable and healthy food choices, and also provide more affordable food options.

    <h2>Restaurants by DavisWiki</h2>
    <p>I know localwiki is a useful resource to share news and updates about a specific geographic location. I have used Davis wiki for several times, which is helpful in finding local information that Google might not know. Davis wiki covers topics including local politics, government, city's parks, schools, and cultural events. Davis wiki lists a series of restaurants that are categorized by countries and types of food. For my capstone project, I will need to explore restaurants from the list and added to my food map.
