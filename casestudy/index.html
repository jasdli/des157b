            <div class="content">
                <p>For my capstone project, I want to create an interactive food guide that combines the Davis Centennial Seal with finding affordable food options or restaurants in the city of Davis.

                    Then users are encouraged to upload their food images taken from restaurants I listed in the guide. After uploading, they can also see other people’ submissions.
                </p>

                <p>Target Users: UC Davis college students who are new to Davis and wish to have a chance to explore the city.</p>
                    
                <p> My goal is to promote engagement and make social connections between Davis people and restaurants. I also want to help Davis newcomers explore local restaurants, creating a sense of community fot them.</p>

            <h2>Project Research</h2>
            <div class="column">
                <p>In order to enhance and broaden the scope of my food guide project, I conducted research on existing food guide websites, including platforms like Yelp. Inspired by these platforms, I recognized the importance of incorporating user interactions, which led me to develop the image upload feature. Initially, I envisioned a unique concept where users could generate their own "seals" using food photos arranged in the shape of a seal. However, after discussing this idea with Glenda, I realized the practicality of it and decided to pivot towards a more feasible solution – a photo gallery.</p>

                <p>Throughout the development process, I found valuable resources that provided information on local restaurants. These resources, such as guides on healthy and vegan restaurants in Davis, served as valuable references for writing my food guide. By leveraging these sources, I was able to gather insights and recommendations to create a comprehensive and informative guide for users.</p>

                <p>After engaging in conversations with my interviewers, I gained a deeper appreciation for the significance of local authentic restaurants. It became evident that these establishments play a crucial role in attracting and engaging customers. Moreover, by dining in these local restaurants, individuals actively contribute to the promotion of Davis agriculture.</p>

                <img src="images/interface.png">
                <p>The initial section of my website allows users to explore an interactive map. By clicking on illustrated icons, users can access images and detailed information about various restaurants, many of which offer vegan food options. To foster a sense of involvement and engagement, I incorporated user-generated content. Users can upload their own food images and also view images shared by others, creating a more immersive experience. </p>

                <p>
                    To minimize cognitive load, I have organized the content into distinct sections, each with its own styling and layout. This division helps users navigate the website more easily and focus on one aspect at a time, reducing cognitive strain. The website employs a fade-in transition between sections, providing a step-by-step feel to the overall experience. </p>

                    <p>I used a consistent color palette throughout my website. To reflect the idea of sustainability and environmentalism, I used green and other natural tones. I chose Poppins font for my project because this sans serif font offers a clean and contemporary look. It also has excellent legibility, ensuring the text is clear and accessible to users. </p>

                <p>User testing results include adding a prominent link to the seal on the website, having more images alongside the text to create a better balance and visual appeal, and enhancing the map feature by adding more content. Users have expressed confusion regarding the "Connect to the Seal" feature. In response to this feedback, I have fixed the animation transition to ensure a smoother experience on the website. Additionally, I have included more information in the guide, such as displaying restaurant and food images, as well as providing details about the food places. I acknowledge that there is still more work to be done, and I will continue to make further improvements.</p>

                <p>

                    Moving forward, I will continue focusing on adjusting the photo gallery. If time permits, I would also like to delve into learning about the traditions and sellers at the farmers market, as this knowledge could contribute to the project's development.</p>

                <p>This project has been a valuable learning experience for me. Through the process of creating a food guide, I delved into the history of Davis and discovered information about local restaurants that I previously had little knowledge of. Additionally, I expanded my knowledge of JavaScript libraries and gained practical experience in implementing them. Continuously working on and refining the project has deepened my understanding of effective styling techniques. Overall, this project holds a special place in my memory, and the sense of accomplishment upon completing such a significant undertaking is truly satisfying.</p>
